# Version 1.0 (Beta)

School is hard enough. Lets make studying easier. 

Study Sets is the simplest app for creating and learning study cards. With three different ways to study (matching, flashcards, and multiple choice) and features such as picture support, OCR, offline and iCloud sync, music integration, export and importing, studying has never been easier. Because we're a subscription based app, you won't ever be upsold to purchase new features. Even better you can try all of the features *for free* with the only exception being that you're limited to creating 50 cards.
